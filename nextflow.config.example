    // Results generated by this workflow are stored in directories that use
    // "sample_id". as directory name. If the "fastq_run_id" is not associated
    // with a "sample_id" (for example, with local files), then a "sample_id"
    // will be automatically assigned by adding "Sample_" to the begining of the
    // "fastq_run_id" (for example, "123_file1_1.fastq" would be assigned the
    // sample_id "Sample_123_file1_1"). The default storage pattern is to make
    // one directory for each "sample_id", with the parameter set as:
    //
    //    outputdir_sample_id = { "${PWD}/${sample_id}" }
    //
    // However, if you have a large amount of samples (typically 1000 +), it may
    // be problematic to have hundreds or thousands of sample directories in
    // one place. To fix this you can assign a glob pattern to organize the
    // results into a cascading file system. For example, the following:
    //
    //    outputdir_sample_id = { "${PWD}/${sample_id[0..2]}/${sample_id[3..4]}/${sample_id[5..6]}/${sample_id.drop(7)}/${sample_id}" }

    // Will organize files downloaded from NCBI in a nesting fashion. The
    // output of the sample_id "SRX0123456" would be put in the directory
    // "/SRX/12/34/56/SRX123456/". You can modify the above glob patterns for
