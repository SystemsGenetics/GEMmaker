## This is a helper script for splitting a very large file
## of NCBI SRAs into smaller chunk files for use with GEMmaker.
##
## Usage:
##   python SRA_splitter.py [file] [chunk-size]
##
## The [file] argument should be the name of the file with the
## list of SRA IDs. It should be a two-column tab-delimited file
## where the fist column is the SRA experiment ID and the second
## is the SRA run ID.
##
## This script will then split the file into files with at most
## [chunk-size] lines per file. Because GEMmaker merges all
## runs for an experiment into a single sample, this script ensures
## that the runs of an experiment are not split between two files.
